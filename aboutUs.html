          <p>
            At Discovery Place, we are dedicated to providing compassionate,
            high-quality Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to support
            children with autism and their families. Our mission is to empower
            every child to reach their fullest potential through personalized,
            evidence-based treatment and a supportive, family-centered approach.

          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We envision a world where every child on the autism spectrum has
            access to the care and resources they need to thrive. As leaders in
            ABA therapy, we are committed to helping children build essential
            life skills, form meaningful relationships, and lead happy,
            fulfilling lives.

          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Every child is unique, and so is our approach to therapy. We work
            closely with families to develop individualized treatment plans that
            address each child’s specific needs and strengths. Our team of
            experienced therapists uses proven, research-backed techniques to
            support progress in a nurturing and comfortable environment. From
            early intervention to life skills training, we are here every step
            of the way.
